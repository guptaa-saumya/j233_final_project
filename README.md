# j233_final_project

 ### Hi, welcome to my final project!
 For my final project, I was really interested in fire data so I looked through the U.S. Fire Administraton's website for some data sets that I would be interested in and came across some that dealt with residential fires. 

 I wanted to see what causes most of the fires for residential buildings and if it varies between 1 & 2 Family homes or homes that have multiple families. 

 So to see what I've done so far, you'll start in the first notebook "1_final_project_cleaning" and see what I've done to get the data ready for me look through. From that notebook I created 5 csv files that all contain the word clean in them so that I can use my next notebook without having to start from scratch cleaning again.\

 Then you'll had to notebook too where I worked on subsetting the data, creating new tables, making charts and analyzed what I saw. 

 #### Thank's for looking at what I did!
